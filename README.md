# Rust Practice Repository

Welcome to my Rust practice repository! This is where I embark on my journey of exploring and mastering Rust programming. In this repository, you'll find a series of projects and exercises that represent my learning path and growing expertise in Rust.

## About

This repository serves as a personal workshop where I delve into various aspects of Rust programming. Each project or exercise within this repository is focused on a specific Rust concept or technique, from the basic syntax to more advanced features.

## Repository Structure

To keep the content organized and track my learning progress effectively, each new practice folder or project is added on a separate branch. Hereâ€™s an overview of the repository structure:

- `main` branch: Contains general information and overarching documentation along with some initial commit code and practices
- Individual branches: Each branch is dedicated to a specific practice or concept in Rust

## Getting Started

To start exploring these projects, you will need the following:
- Rust installed on your system ([Official Rust Installation Guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started))
- Your preferred code editor (e.g., [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))

### Cloning the Repository

You can clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hasnat-Ahmed-Goheer/Rust-practice.git
